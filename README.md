# Better Workday Calendar

A browser extension that adds functionality to ISU Workday. V1 includes an additional button to export your course schedule to an ICS file. However, this project can include additional features. If you have suggestions, please contact [hartsul@iastate.edu](mailto:hartsul@iastate.edu).

This extension gives Iowa State students the ability to export their course schedule from Workday. By adding a button to the 'View My Courses' page ( Academic Records -> Current Classes ), users can download an ICS file with their class schedule; the ICS file can be imported to most calendar apps.

By importing an ICS file, you can save add all your classes at once. 

This extension was adapted from an existing extension, [Better Workday Calendar](https://github.com/SeabertYuan/better-workday-calendar), that was made for The Unviversity of British Columbia. 

It appears that small differences exist between different Universities' Workdays, so this extension only works for ISU. However, feel free to copy and make your own version for your school; I plan to add instructoins to make this process relatively easy. Please reach out with any feedback or questions.
